    "The [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) was introduced by Professor Dean De Cock in 2011 for use in data science education. It contains 2,919 observations of housing sales in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. There are a total of 79 features describing each house's size, quality, area, age, and other miscellaneous attributes. \n",

    ">Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence."
